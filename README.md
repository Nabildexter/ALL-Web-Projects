# ALL-Web-Projects
More or less All/Some of my Web-based Projects


The front end projects, most of them are done a long time ago and use Bootstrap 4 and are simple.


A lot of the full-stack or back-end projects will require you to run "npm i" to install packages. A lot of them also run on localhost 3000.
