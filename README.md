# ALL-Web-Projects
More or less All/Some of my Web-based Projects


------------------------------------------------

The front end projects, most of the Bootstrap 3/4 projects, were done a longgg time ago and are simple. The newer Bootstrap 5, Figma, Balsamiq, Angular, React Mongodb, Express, Node Web projects are better.


------------------------------------------------

A lot of the full-stack or back-end projects will require you to run "npm i" to install packages. A lot of them also run on localhost 3000.

------------------------------------------------

The full stack web applications, the one's listed with both front-end and back-end tools will either come with instructoins under readme files or they present links in their readme files.
